Test files count for testing of different capabilities of the Parsybone tool.
All the tests can be executed at once using the test.sh Unix script.

There are 3 sorts of files, denoted by the first word in the name of the file:
Checks - these files contain more specific models whose results are further checked.
Errors - models that are supposed to result with a failure (mostly because of wrong syntax)
Tests - files that are simple required to go through smoothly

Checks description:
check_basic.dbm : this file contains simple model with partial parametrization, which has a single resulting parametrization that is compared to what it actually produces during check
check_distribution.dbm : this very simple model is partitioned and then sum of parametrizations from the partitions is compared to an output of a single run
check_label.dbm : this model apart from others contains multiple different edge labels that result in it being allowed to produce only a single parametrization that is checked
check_mask1.dbm, check_mask2.dbm : currently unused
check_parametrized.dbm : this model is fully parametrized and produces only a single parametrization

Errors description:
error_label_formula.dbm : a formula given as an edge lable is syntactically incorrect
error_label_noun.dbm : a noun describing an edge label is syntactically incorrect 
error_targe_value_below_zero.dbm : one logical parameter is below zero
error_targe_value_over_maximal_level.dbm : one logical parameter is above maximal activation level of the regulated specie
error_threshold_below_zero.dbm : one threshold of a regulation is lower than 0
error_threshold_mixed.dbm : one threshold has correct value, but is followed by some string
error_threshold_nonnumerical.dbm : one threshold is given by a symbol
error_threshold_over_maximal_level.dbm : one threshold is higher than the maximal level of the regulator
error_threshold_zero.dbm : one threshold is zero, which is forbidden since it does not really make sense from the biological point of view

Test:
test_label_formula.dbm : tests few formulas for edge labels, only for the syntax
test_label_noun.dbm : tests syntax for all the possible nouns that can be given for the edge labels
