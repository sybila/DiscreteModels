This repository suits as a storage for models of regulatory networks written using a DBM language. These models are suitable for use with the Parsybone model checker (https://github.com/sybila/Parsybone). For a usage or language description, refer to Parsybone Manual (https://github.com/sybila/Parsybone-manual) - the model described in the manual as an example can be find in the file Example.dbm in this folder.

Content of the subfolders:
Bacteriophage: Models of lythic and lysogenic fate of a cell infected by the Bacteriophage lambda.
IRMA: Model of an IRMA network with six nodes.
MammalianCC: Model of a mammalian cell cycle.
Rat_CNS: Model of neural developent of a rat.
Test: Models that are used for testing of the Parsybone tool and a testing script.
