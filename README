This repository suits as a storage for models of regulatory networks written using a DBM language. These models are suitable for use with the Parsybone model checker (https://github.com/sybila/Parsybone). For a usage or language description, refer to Parsybone Manual (https://github.com/sybila/Parsybone-manual) - the model described in the manual as an example can be find in the file Example.dbm in this folder.

All the models in main folders are supposed to be used with the latest version (1.1 or newer), old, incompatible models are stored in directories VER_0_0 and VER_1_0.

BIOLOGICAL MODELS:
Bacteriophage: Models of lythic and lysogenic fate of a cell infected by the Bacteriophage lambda.
IRMA: Model of an IRMA network with six nodes.
MammalianCC: Model of a mammalian cell cycle.
Rat_CNS: Model of neural developent of a rat.

TECHNICAL MODELS
Running_example: An example used in the technical report of FI MU.
Many_Node: A models of a networks with more than 10 components.

Test: Models that are used for testing of the Parsybone tool and a testing script.
