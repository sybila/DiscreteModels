This repository suits as a storage for models of regulatory networks written using a DBM language. These models are suitable for use with the Parsybone model checker (https://github.com/sybila/Parsybone). For a usage or language description, refer to Parsybone Manual (https://github.com/sybila/Parsybone-manual).

Content of the folders:
Bacteriophage: Models of lythic and lysogenic fate of a cell infected by a Bacteriophage lambda.
IRMA: Model of an IRMA network.
MammalianCC: Model of a mammalian cell cycle.
Rat_CNS: Model of neural developent in a mouse.
Test: Models that are used for testin of the Parsybone tool together with a testing script.
