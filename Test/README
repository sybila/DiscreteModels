Test files count for testing of different capabilities of the Parsybone tool.
All the tests can be executed at once using the test.sh Unix script.

There are 3 sorts of files, denoted by the first word in the name of the file:
Errors - models that are supposed to result with a failure, they all test for error during the parsing, therefore their error value should be equal to 1.
Tests - files that are simple required to go through smoothly
Checks - these files contain more specific models whose results are further checked.
