Test files count for testing of different capabilities of the Parsybone tool.
All the tests can be executed at once using the test.sh Unix script.

There are 3 sorts of files, denoted by the first word in the name of the file:
Errors - models that are supposed to result with a failure, they all test for error during the parsing, therefore their error value should be equal to 1.
Tests - files that are simple required to go through smoothly
Checks - these files contain more specific models whose results are further checked.

Errors description
error_targe_value_below_zero.dbm : one logical parameter is below zero
error_targe_value_over_maximal_level.dbm : one logical parameter is above maximal activation level of the regulated specie
error_threshold_below_zero.dbm : one threshold of a regulation is lower than 0
error_threshold_mixed.dbm : one threshold has correct value, but is followed by some string
error_threshold_nonnumerical.dbm : one threshold is given by a symbol
error_threshold_over_maximal_level.dbm : one threshold is higher than the maximal level of the regulator
error_threshold_zero.dbm : one threshold is zero, which is forbidden since it does not really make sense from the biological point of view
